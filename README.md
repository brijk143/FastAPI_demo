# FastAPI_demo

# üè• Patient Management API using FastAPI

This is a simple and fully functional  **FastAPI** for managing patient health records. The application allows you to **create**, **view**, **edit**, **delete**, and **sort** patient data ‚Äî all while automatically calculating their **BMI (Body Mass Index)** and assigning a **health verdict** like *Underweight*, *Normal*, *Overweight*, or *Obese*.



##  What this project does

- Stores patient details in a local JSON file (`patient.json`)
- Calculates BMI automatically from height and weight
- Gives a health verdict based on BMI value
- Allows CRUD operations on patient data
- Sorts patients based on height or weight
- Validates all input using FastAPI & Pydantic
