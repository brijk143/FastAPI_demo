# Patient Management API using FastAPI

This is a simple and fully functional  **FastAPI** for managing patient health records. The application allows you to **create**, **view**, **edit**, **delete**, and **sort** patient data 


##  What this project does

- Stores patient details in a local JSON file (`patient.json`)
- Calculates BMI automatically from height and weight
- Gives a health verdict based on BMI value
- Allows CRUD operations on patient data
- Sorts patients based on height or weight
- Validates all input using FastAPI & Pydantic
